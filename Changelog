# Changelog

## v2.5

New framework.

When counting hits and missed fire, do it only for waves which passed over a
bot. This avoid counting as missed the waves which are still in the air when
enemy dies, also for the case of virtual bullets, it does not count as a miss
the case when radar was looking away during the wave pass over the bot.

Increase number of bots to which I fire virtual waves at melee: 4 -> 10

## v2.4

New framework.

Fixed bug, with double counting of the master bot gun shots, which was
introduced in v2.3

## v2.3

New framework.
Extended guns set firing in 1on1

## v2.2

new framework

In melee radar lock now 2 clicks earlier, than before. Seems to boost score
with my test set.

Circular gun falls back to linear gun scenario, if not enough history
available.

Master bot does not fire linear gun anymore, circular one does its function.

## v2.1

new framework

Remove guess factor based guns from the enemy guns array.
These guns were introduced since v1.6 but apparently make the master bot motion more
predictive.  It hearts IWillFireNoBullets roborumble stats,
up to version 2.0 the APS is lower.
Buy now enemy firing and master bot motion logic is the same as it was in
v1.6

Added enemy wave count, to implement lagging guess factor gun.

## v2.0

bug fix: guess factor use the lateral velocity from wrong time

New gun: flipLastGuessFactorGun. I note that many bots including my own
have next wave guess factor close to oposite of the previous wave. This gun
tries to exploit it.

## v1.9

New framework.
Undo orthogonal motion. It seems to be a weaker motion

## v1.8

New framework.
Fixed bug introduced in v1.7:  in 1on1 my bot locked itself in a corner, due
to no danger from corner, and only shallow angle search within orthogonal direction to
the enemy.

## v1.7
Enemy fires guess factors gun too, new decaying stats guess factor gun, on
1on1 motion more orthogonal to the line to the enemy.

## v1.6
New framework with guess factor gun. Some optimization to reduce unnecessary
CPU load.

## v1.5

Added bullet shielders detection, and fire with offset to circumvent it.
If bot hit enemy bullet, then enemy wave which carries this bullet is removed,
since it has no danger.

Exact path is attempting to find a better path every turn, but with smaller
number of trials than full search.

## v1.4
New framework with added random gun

## v1.4
New framework with added random gun

## v1.3
New framework with fixed circular gun

## v1.2
New framework with circular gun

## v1.1

Inspire of my initial hope melee performance dropped, I think this
due to bugs in the target weights selection. Will see if this one helps.

1on1 performance improved, but there is only one target.

## v1.0
Versions of 0.6 - 1.0 skipped, since v1.0 is quite different

Framework lib v1.0, I expect drastic improvements in melee.


## v0.6
Using v0.6 framework lib

## v0.5
Using v0.5 framework lib


## v0.4 - 0.1
lost in history since the frame work was taken from IWillFireNoBullet robot.
So see its version history, as well as, framework lib history log.
