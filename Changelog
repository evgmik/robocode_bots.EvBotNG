# Changelog

## v1.4
New framework with added random gun

## v1.3
New framework with fixed circular gun

## v1.2
New framework with circular gun

## v1.1

Inspire of my initial hope melee performance dropped, I think this
due to bugs in the target weights selection. Will see if this one helps.

1on1 performance improved, but there is only one target.

## v1.0
Versions of 0.6 - 1.0 skipped, since v1.0 is quite different

Framework lib v1.0, I expect drastic improvements in melee.


## v0.6
Using v0.6 framework lib

## v0.5
Using v0.5 framework lib


## v0.4 - 0.1
lost in history since the frame work was taken from IWillFireNoBullet robot.
So see its version history, as well as, framework lib history log.
