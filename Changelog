# Changelog

## v1.6
New framework with guess factor gun. Some optimization to reduce unnecessary
CPU load.

## v1.5

Added bullet shielders detection, and fire with offset to circumvent it.
If bot hit enemy bullet, then enemy wave which carries this bullet is removed,
since it has no danger.

Exact path is attempting to find a better path every turn, but with smaller
number of trials than full search.

## v1.4
New framework with added random gun

## v1.4
New framework with added random gun

## v1.3
New framework with fixed circular gun

## v1.2
New framework with circular gun

## v1.1

Inspire of my initial hope melee performance dropped, I think this
due to bugs in the target weights selection. Will see if this one helps.

1on1 performance improved, but there is only one target.

## v1.0
Versions of 0.6 - 1.0 skipped, since v1.0 is quite different

Framework lib v1.0, I expect drastic improvements in melee.


## v0.6
Using v0.6 framework lib

## v0.5
Using v0.5 framework lib


## v0.4 - 0.1
lost in history since the frame work was taken from IWillFireNoBullet robot.
So see its version history, as well as, framework lib history log.
